## Working tree

The files [Crowdfunding-Monolitics.ipynb](./Crowdfunding-Monolitics.ipynb "Crowdfunding-Monolitics.ipynb") and [Crowdfunding-MCS.ipynb](./Crowdfunding-MCS.ipynb "Crowdfunding-MCS.ipynb") contain the main routines for experiments in monolithic and multiple classification systems, respectively.

[shap_results](./shap_results "shap_results") folder stores summary and dependence plots from some of the models avaliated.

[utils](./utils "utils") folder contains utilities code shared on Monolithics and MCS experiments
